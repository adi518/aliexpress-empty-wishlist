# aliexpress-empty-wishlist

Annoyingly, Aliexpress does not provide a way to empty your wishlist, which can grow large quite fast. This script will login to Aliexpress on your behalf, navigate to the wishlist page and start emptying it.

## Usage

Install, setup a `.env` file with your Aliexpress credentials and hit `yarn start`.
